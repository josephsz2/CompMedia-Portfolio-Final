            <p>Cavern is a personal project that I have been working on. It is a 3D platformer bullet-hell focusing on tight execution and monolithic bosses
                in a mysterious and melancholic world, taking inspirations from games such as "A Hat in Time" and "Titan Soul." Currently, "Cavern" is in
                pre-production stage with many of the fundamentals of the game being solidified. It is currently intended to be a project I lead in the
                VGDev club at Gerogia Tech, but I will continue to pursue the project until it is fully complete.

        <p>The general set-up of "Cavern" involves the player waking up, deep inside some sort of cave. As the player explores the area around them, they
            discover they in an area that is filled with machine-like structures and techology, mixed in with the earth around it. This open area features
            moderate platforming and more basic obstacles that connect to boss areas. These will be themed arenas where the play with have to face off 
            against a giant machine, with these battles being the main focus of the game. They are intended to be very difficult and frantic battles that
            test what the player can do.
