        <p >Willow is my one of the first two projects I have worked on. It is a VGDev club project led by Yoon Lee and Mitchell Phillip. It is a 2D bullet-hell rougelike,
            featuring a weapon crafting system and a gameplay loop that focusing around recruiting NPCs to a growing festival. My role for this project was
            minor design work, including weapons, rooms, enemies, NPCs, and items.

        <p>Starfall is the other of my first two projects. It is also a VGDev club project, led by Ben Lock. It is a 3D rougelike built around fast movement and
            extreme aggression. I was the head designer on this project, focusing on creating and tweaking core combat and mechanical systems in the game, such as 
            the "Link" system that the combat is based around.
